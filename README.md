InspireOS Aero is a fork of alok.'s  InspireOS, made to be much lighter, better to manipulate and more rich in features. Despite what alok. claims, InspireOS Aero does not contain any virus.<br>
This repo is mostly for collaborating on the development of InspireOS Aero and storing builds. You may request to collaborate on the Dev channel via the Discussions tab.
